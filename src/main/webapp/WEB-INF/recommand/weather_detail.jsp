                            <p>The cast brass and cast stainless steel burners have the smallest burrs — by far. This
                                will mean less chaos in the gas flow, fewer trapped particulate matter in the burner and
                            a cleaner burning grill. The following comparison shows how the ports are formed.</p>
                            <p>Why is port formation important? Several reasons. If the hole is punched into a sheet
                                metal burner, it leaves a large tab inside the burner that will caus e more chaos while
                                burning. It is more apt to hold trapped food particles and grease, and is therefore more
                            likely to burn through. (Note the Alfresco burner photo below.</p>

                                <li><span>01.</span> Combine all of the ingredients, kneading to form a smooth dough.
                                </li>
                                <li><span>02.</span> Allow the dough to rise, in a lightly greased, covered bowl, until
                                it’s doubled in size,</li>
                                <li><span>03.</span> about 90 minutes.</li>
                                <li><span>04.</span> Gently divide the dough in half; it’ll deflate somewhat. Gently
                                    shape the dough into two oval loaves; or, for longer loaves, two 10″ to 11″ logs.
                                </li>
                                <li><span>05.</span> Place the loaves on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
                                sheet. Cover and let</li>
                                <li><span>06.</span> rise until very puffy, about 1 hour. Towards the end of the rising
                                time, preheat the oven</li>
                                <li><span>07.</span> to 425°F.</li>
                                <li><span>08.</span> Spray the loaves with lukewarm water. Make two fairly deep diagonal

                            <p>Molded ports in cast burners seem like they would be a good idea, but there is
                                considerable difficulty in making them uniform. Thus, it is quicker and less expensive
                            to drill.</p>
